    <p>Hello, my name is Aric.</p>
    <p>I generally like cats due to their softness and in particular enjoy snuggly cats. I think the main negative for me with cats is of course the litter box. My favourite cat is definitely my brothers orange tabby named Tim, he's a ridiculously fluffy idiot, but he's hilarious.</p>

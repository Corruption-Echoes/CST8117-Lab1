        The Erwise browser is listed as the first web browser with a graphical user interface, developed by four Finnish college students in 1991 and released in 1992. 
        The browser was <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/Erwise/Review.html">reviewed</a> by Tim Berner-Lee(credited as the inventor of the web itself) In april of 1992 upon it's release. 
        He notes some features such as multifont text, underlining of links, the ability to have multiple windows(though he notes "If your window manager is set to place all new windows interactively, then this is a pain")
        and the ability to remotely search indexes of other websites(though only 12 existed at the time of testing).

        Erwise generally seems to have been noted as quite the accomplishment, however the project was not continued <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2009/03/03/the-greatest-internet-pioneers-you-never-heard-of-the-story-of-erwise-and-four-finns-who-showed-the-way-to-the-web-browser/2/">due to a lack of funding.</a> 
         It's intriguing to see the evolution of browsers overtime, from the very first WorldWideWeb(which rebranded to Nexus shown below), to the first graphical user interface of Erwise(Above).
